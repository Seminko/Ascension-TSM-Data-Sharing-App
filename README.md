- Clone repo
- Install luadata from requirements.txt. Everything else should come with Python (hopefully). If not, lemme know.
- Run main.py
- The scipt will check for updated files and if there is new scan timestamp will push it to the db.
  - **Currently for Area 52 only!**
----------
- To test it:
  - Run main.py.
  - Do a full or at least a partial scan (for a small group).
  - /reload in game.
  - Watch logs - next loop it should detect it and send it to the db

Do not share with anyone else yet pls.
